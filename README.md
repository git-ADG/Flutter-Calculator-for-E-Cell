<p id="description">A scientific calculator app made in Flutter for the technical team recruitment of E-Cell, NIT Silchar. The calculator has 2 modes- normal mode and scientific mode. The interchange button in the bottom left corner can switch between the 2 calculator modes. The scientific mode has the following functions- pi, sqrt, exp, power, log, ln, trigonometric(sine, cosine and tangent) and their inverses. The unit for trigonometric functions is radian. Also, for log function both base as well as number must be specified in the format: log(base, num). For example, for natural log of 2 we must write log(10, 2) as shown in the demo video. A simple splash screen also appears on start-up</p>
